## 1. Introduction
<!-- A  concise description of the current iteration of work. -->
GSARaman allows users to extract relevant data from raman spectographs using an automated Lorentzian fitting. The current iteration of the tool will include improvements in tool performance. This iteration of GSARaman will be released as a standalone tool as well as a feature of the Gr-ResQ (Graphene Recipes for the Synthesis of High Quality Materials) database suite.

### 1.1 Purpose and Vision Statement
<!--Why are we building this tool? What is the key benefit? How does it relate to existing tools and existing software? How does it fit into the overall objectives for the nanoMFG node? Who will use it?-->
Raman spectographs are one of the primary resources for graphene synthesis analysis. GSARaman will permit users to extract information from these Raman spectrographs like defect density and graphene quality. These features will inform users and augment machine learning on the data by providing it with objective metrics to optimize. GSARaman allows users to analyze single Raman spectra or a full spectral map, each pixel of which is resolved to single Raman spectra. This tool will be released as a standalone research tool and as a feature of the "gresq" graphene synthesis database dashboard.

### 1.2 References
<!--List any documents or background material that are relevant.  Links are useful. For instance, a link to a wiki or readme page in the project repository, or link to a uploaded file (doc, pdf, ppt, etc.).-->

## 2 Overview and Major Planned Features
<!--Provide and overview characterising this proposed release.  Describe how users will interact with each proposed feature. Include a schematic/diagram to illustrate an overview of proposed software and achitecture componets for the project-->

### 2.1 Product Background and Strategic Fit
<!--Provide context for the proposed product.  Is this a completely new projects, or next version of an existing project? This can include a description of any contextual research, or the status of any existing prototype application.  If this SPD describes a component, describe its relationship to larger system. Can include diagrams.-->

### 2.2 Scope and Limitations for Current Release
<!--List the all planned goals/features for this release.  These should be links to issues.  Add a new subsection for each release.  Equally important, document feature you explicity are not doing at this time-->


##### 2.2.1 Planned Features
##### 2.0.0
* Add basic database connectivity
  - Include source dist of GrResq for database
* Query button for loading Rmaan spectra using the database

### 2.3 Scope and Limitations for Subsequent Releases
<!--Short summary of  future envisioned roadmap for subsequent efforts.-->

##### 2.1.0

### 2.3 Operating Environment
<!--Describe the target environment.  Identify components or application that are needed.  Describe technical infrastructure need to support the application.-->

### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
<!--This could include pre-existing code that needs to be incorporated ,a certain programming language or toolkit and software dependencies.  Describe the origin and rationale for each constraint.-->

## 3 User Interaction and Design

### 3.1 Classes of Users
<!--Identify classes (types) of users that you anticipate will use the product.  Provide any relevant context about each class that may influence how the product is used: 
The tasks the class of users will perform
Access and privilege level
Features used
Experience level
Type of interaction
Provide links to any user surveys, questionnaires, interviews, feedback or other relevant information.-->

Type | Access Level | Features Used | Experience Level | Type of interaction
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Community User | All | All | Novice | Used for own research
nanoMFG User | All | All | Experienced | Used for generating data for Gr-ResQ database


### 3.2 User Requirements
<!-- Provide a list of issue links to document the main set of user requirements to be satisfied by this release.  Use the user requirement template to draft thense issues.  A well written user requirement should be easy to justify (Rational) and should be testable.  List in order of priority as must have, should have or nice to have for each use case. -->
User(s)|Requirement| Priority
|Community|Community users shall be able to load Raman Spectra from Recipies stored in the GrResQ database| Must Have

### 3.3 Proposed User Interface
<!--Could include drawn mockups, screenshots of prototypes, comparison to existing software and other descriptions.-->

### 3.4 Documentation Plan
<!-- List planned documentation activities -->

### 3.5 User Outreach Plan
<!-- List upcoming activities designed to elicit user feedback and/or engage new users.  Use issues for activities that will be completed this iteration-->

## 4. Data And Quality Attributes

### 4.1 Data Dictionary
<!--Summarize inputs and outputs for the application.-->

### 4.2 Usability and Performance
<!--Summarize usability requirements such as easy of adoption for new users (eg example data),  inline documentation, avoiding errors, efficient interaction, etc.  Describe performance expectations  and/or document challenges.  Note you can reference user requirements from above if needed. -->

### 4.3 Testing, Verification and Validation
<!--Describe What data is necessary to verify the basic functionality of the application.  Provide a testing plan that includes a list of issues for each planned activity.  Describe data sets that are needed to test validation.-->

### 4.4 Uncertainty Quantification
<!--Identify and document possible sources of uncertainty. Categorize with standard labels, such as parametric, structural, algorithmic, experimental, interpolation.

Develop a plan for measuring and documenting uncertainty, e.g., using forward propagation or inverse UQ, and showing it in the application, if applicable.-->
