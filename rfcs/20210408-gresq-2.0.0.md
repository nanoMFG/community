## 1. Introduction
A  concise description of the current iteration of work.

### 1.1 Purpose and Vision Statement
<!-- Why are we building this tool?
What is the key benefit
How does it relate to existing tools and existing software?
How does it fit into the overall objectives for the nano **manufacturing** node?
Who will use this software?
-->

### 1.2 References
<!--List any documents or background material that are relevant.  Links are useful. For instance, a link to a wiki or readme page in the project repository, or link to a uploaded file (doc, pdf, ppt, etc.).-->

## 2 Overview and Major Planned Features
<!--Provide and overview characterizing this proposed release.  Describe how users will interact with each proposed feature. Include a schematic/diagram to illustrate an overview of proposed software and architecture components for the project-->

### 2.1 Product Background and Strategic Fit
<!--Provide context for the proposed product.  Is this a completely new projects, or next version of an existing project? This can include a description of any contextual research, or the status of any existing prototype application.  If this SPD describes a component, describe its relationship to larger system. Can include diagrams.-->

### 2.2 Scope and Limitations for Current Release
<!--List the all planned goals/features for this release.  These should be links to issues.  Add a new subsection for each release.  Equally important, document feature you explicitly are not doing at this time-->


##### 2.2.1 Planned Features
* [Implement an API web service for Gr-RESQ](https://github.com/nanoMFG/GSAMain/issues/95)


#### 2.2.2 Release Notes 
##### v#.#.#

### 2.3 Scope and Limitations for Subsequent Releases
<!--Short summary of  future envisioned roadmap for subsequent efforts.-->

### 2.3 Operating Environment
<!--Describe the target environment.  Identify components or application that are needed.  Describe technical infrastructure need to support the application.-->

### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
<!--This could include pre-existing code that needs to be incorporated ,a certain programming language or toolkit and software dependencies.  Describe the origin and rationale for each constraint.-->

## 3 User Interaction and Design

### 3.1 Classes of Users
<!--Identify classes (types) of users that you anticipate will use the product.  Provide any relevant context about each class that may influence how the product is used: 
The tasks the class of users will perform
Access and privilege level
Features used
Experience level
Type of interaction
Provide links to any user surveys, questionnaires, interviews, feedback or other relevant information.-->

### 3.2 Software Requirements for Users
<!-- Provide a list of issue links to document the main set of user requirements to be satisfied by this release.  Use the user requirement template to draft these issues.  A well written user requirement should be easy to justify (Rational) and should be testable.  List in order of priority as must have, should have or nice to have for each use case. -->

### 3.3 Proposed User Interface
<!--Could include drawn mockups, screenshots of prototypes, comparison to existing software and other descriptions.-->

### 3.4 Documentation Plan
<!-- List planned documentation activities -->

### 3.5 User Outreach Plan
<!-- List upcoming activities designed to elicit user feedback and/or engage new users.  Use issues for activities that will be completed this iteration-->

## 4. Data And Quality Attributes

### 4.1 Data Dictionary
<!--Summarize inputs and outputs for the application.-->

### Application Data Model
Version 2.0 will be a good opportunity to revisit the application data model and make improvements both to improve data 
integrety of the current database and to anticipate future needs of the application.

#### Key changes in 2.0.0
* Establish a one to many relation ship from "recipie" to "sample".  Currently the sample is tied to recipe 
where the recipie table augments the sample data.  The idea her is to model multiple runs(samples) per recipie
* Further normalize the data relationships
* Separate substrate attributes from the "sample" table
* Separate furnace attributes from the recipe
* Accomodate time-series or timestamped data from lab view or other 


#### Data Entity Descriptions
**recipe** - A set of parameters and a planned sequence of steps used to create a sample.  
**sample** -
**Raman File** -  
**SEM File** -
**Preparation Step** -  

#### Naming Conventions
###### Definitions
**PascalCase** - Words separated by uppercase letters: `WordAnotherWord`   
**camelCase** - Smake as PascalCase but leading word lowercase: `wordAnotherWord`  
**snake_case** - Words separated by underscore: `word_another_word`  
**UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** - Uppercase words separated by underscore: `WORD_ANOTHER_WORD`  
**ABRIVIATED_UPPR_SNK_CS** - Abbriviated words (remove no-leading vowels) separated bu underscores: `WRD_ANTHR_WRD`  


**Table(Schema) Names** - 

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### 4.2 Usability and Performance
<!--Summarize usability requirements such as easy of adoption for new users (eg example data),  inline documentation, avoiding errors, efficient interaction, etc.  Describe performance expectations  and/or document challenges.  Note you can reference user requirements from above if needed. -->

### 4.3 Testing, Verification and Validation
<!--Describe What data is necessary to verify the basic functionality of the application.  Provide a testing plan that includes a list of issues for each planned activity.  Describe data sets that are needed to test validation.-->

### 4.4 Uncertainty Quantification
<!--Identify and document possible sources of uncertainty. Categorize with standard labels, such as parametric, structural, algorithmic, experimental, interpolation.

Develop a plan for measuring and documenting uncertainty, e.g., using forward propagation or inverse UQ, and showing it in the application, if applicable.-->
