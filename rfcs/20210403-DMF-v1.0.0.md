## 1. Introduction


### 1.1 Purpose and Vision Statement
<!-- Why are we building this tool?
What is the key benefit
How does it relate to existing tools and existing software?
How does it fit into the overall objectives for the nano **manufacturing** node?
Who will use this software?
-->
The first version of the DMf is intended to provide experimental labs working with 2D materials with framework to describe, catalog, analyse and publish data.

##### Relationship to Existing Software
Seems there are a number of commertional options for scientific data management software (SDMS)

##### Our Approach

### 1.2 References
<!--List any documents or background material that are relevant.  Links are useful. For instance, a link to a wiki or readme page in the project repository, or link to a uploaded file (doc, pdf, ppt, etc.).-->

## 2 Overview and Major Planned Features
<!--Provide and overview characterising this proposed release.  Describe how users will interact with each proposed feature. Include a schematic/diagram to illustrate an overview of proposed software and achitecture componets for the project-->

### 2.1 Product Background and Strategic Fit
<!--Provide context for the proposed product.  Is this a completely new projects, or next version of an existing project? This can include a description of any contextual research, or the status of any existing prototype application.  If this SPD describes a component, describe its relationship to larger system. Can include diagrams.-->

### 2.2 Scope and Limitations for Current Release
<!--List the all planned goals/features for this release.  These should be links to issues.  Add a new subsection for each release.  Equally important, document feature you explicity are not doing at this time-->


##### 2.2.1 Planned Features

#### 2.2.2 Release Notes 
##### v#.#.#

### 2.3 Scope and Limitations for Subsequent Releases
<!--Short summary of  future envisioned roadmap for subsequent efforts.-->

### 2.3 Operating Environment
<!--Describe the target environment.  Identify components or application that are needed.  Describe technical infrastructure need to support the application.-->

### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
<!--This could include pre-existing code that needs to be incorporated ,a certain programming language or toolkit and software dependencies.  Describe the origin and rationale for each constraint.-->

## 3 User Interaction and Design

### 3.1 Classes of Users
<!--Identify classes (types) of users that you anticipate will use the product.  Provide any relevant context about each class that may influence how the product is used: 
The tasks the class of users will perform
Access and privilege level
Features used
Experience level
Type of interaction
Provide links to any user surveys, questionnaires, interviews, feedback or other relevant information.-->

1. **Experimentalist** - User primarily focused on lab process and experiments, will interface with system mostly when uploading data and utilizing both **predictive** and **prescriptive** analytics.  Includes academic research teams developing 2D materials looking to crowd-source data sets and experimental runs 
2. **Data Scientist** - User focused on accessing data to provide both analysis and machine learning models including **descriptive**, **predictive** and **prescriptive** analysis that can be used by experimentalists, application developers and manufacturing researchers
3. **Application Developer** - Developer of full applications that incorporated data and analysis features to enable researchers to access and use integrated data and analysis.
4. **Data Integrator** - User/developer focuses on developing application data models for application developers and source/transform models and tools for ingesting data from sources such as a graphene synthesis lab.
5. **Manufacturing Researcher**  

2. Industry partners researching scalable manumaxfuting processes for nano-materials 

### 3.2 Software Requirements for Users
<!-- Provide a list of issue links to document the main set of user requirements to be satisfied by this release.  Use the user requirement template to draft these issues.  A well written user requirement should be easy to justify (Rational) and should be testable.  List in order of priority as must have, should have or nice to have for each use case. -->

#### Proposed
1. Provide a framework for application developers to develop application data models to enable project application developers to build interfaces and UI elements.
2. Provide a framework for data integrators to interface common lab data collection tools with application data models to enable academic researches efficient methods to upload experimental runs.
3. Provide a framework for data scientists to deploy machine learning pipelines and output features and metrics back into the data sets and applications
4. Provide tools for both open data access and various levels of security
5. Provide tools to archive and publish data sets, such as the particular data used when publishing an academic paper. 

### 3.3 Proposed User Interface
<!--Could include drawn mockups, screenshots of prototypes, comparison to existing software and other descriptions.-->

### 3.4 Documentation Plan
<!-- List planned documentation activities -->

### 3.5 User Outreach Plan
<!-- List upcoming activities designed to elicit user feedback and/or engage new users.  Use issues for activities that will be completed this iteration-->
#### Pre-Release
1. nanoMFG targeted I-Corps outreach: Determine state of current tools gaps in available resources and targeted set of features required for a MVP.

## 4. Data And Quality Attributes

### 4.1 Data Dictionary
<!--Summarize inputs and outputs for the application.-->

### 4.2 Usability and Performance
<!--Summarize usability requirements such as easy of adoption for new users (eg example data),  inline documentation, avoiding errors, efficient interaction, etc.  Describe performance expectations  and/or document challenges.  Note you can reference user requirements from above if needed. -->

### 4.3 Testing, Verification and Validation
<!--Describe What data is necessary to verify the basic functionality of the application.  Provide a testing plan that includes a list of issues for each planned activity.  Describe data sets that are needed to test validation.-->

### 4.4 Uncertainty Quantification
<!--Identify and document possible sources of uncertainty. Categorize with standard labels, such as parametric, structural, algorithmic, experimental, interpolation.

Develop a plan for measuring and documenting uncertainty, e.g., using forward propagation or inverse UQ, and showing it in the application, if applicable.-->
