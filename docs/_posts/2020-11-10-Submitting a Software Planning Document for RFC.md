# Creating a New nanoMFG RFC

1. Navigate to the `nanoMFG/community` repo: [https://github.com/nanoMFG/community](https://github.com/nanoMFG/community) 
and find the `rfcs` folder: https://github.com/nanoMFG/community/tree/master/rfcs.

2. Follow the directions in the [RFC-procedure document](https://github.com/nanoMFG/community/blob/master/governance/RFC-process.md) 
(which is also linked to from the Readme.md in the rfcs directory).

Notes:  
* After adding the file, use the "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" option to automatically create a PR.  
* If submitting from an external commit/push, you must push to a branch other than `master`.  Then open a PR from that branch to master to server as
the RFC PR.
