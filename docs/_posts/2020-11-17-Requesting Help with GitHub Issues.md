## Asking for Help via GitHub Issues

Github Issues is are a great way to capture complicated plans in a collection of simple issues that can be assigned, 
labeled, commented on, opened closed etc.  To get started with GitHub issues refer to these great help resources.  
[about issues](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues)  
[Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)  

In addition to helping your team manage a project the nanoMFG node is rolling out an issue-based help system for requesting help from
the NanoMFG DevOps team.  If there is something you would like help with (coding issues, nanoHub question, a nasty bug) 
simply create an issue and apply the `help wanted` label -- that's it!

The issue can be created either in you project repo, or in the community repo.  If you create the issue in the community repo, be sure to add a
`project:yourproject` label, where `yourproject` is the shortname of your project as defined on nanoHub.  
Apply other labels as appropriate (eg. bug, question, etc.). All issues with the `help wanted` lable will find there way to the nanoMFG DevOps team.

nanoMFG developers with some exprience rolling out application, please consider joining the nanoMFG DevOps team!  
This is a great way to help out new projects and build a strong developer community among colleges (ot to mention a good way to boost your Github impact stats).
