# Create a nanoMFG Tool Repository
For those with new membership to github.com/nanoMFG, and/or those ready to start a new tool, here are instructions for creating a new project repo: <br>

1) visit github.com/nanoMFG and accept invitation<br>
2) Hit the "new" button :<br>
3) Select repo options and create repo.
   - Try to use a relatively short name with no spaces.<br>
   - Add a description<br>
   - Select a template such as "toolstart-jupyter" for a new jupyter notebook tool.  
Make the repo public if you intent to release via open source or private if you want to keep hidden until release.  
4) Refer to the [first planning activity](https://nanomfg.github.io/community/Planning%20Activities#review-github-accounts-and-team-membership) to create a project team so all of your collaborators have access.
